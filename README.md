# NDHU Reviews

Graduation Project for my computer science and information engineering degree. Worked in a team of 2 with a supervisor. It is a web application that allows NDHU students to make better informed decisions on the courses they want to take, according to others experiences. It allows for NDHU students that are logged in and verified to write and post reviews for classes that they have already taken. Students can search and read these reviews as well as like helpful reviews. It provides a very user friendly interface, with many ways of searching through the thousands of classes that NDHU offers. It also has its own chatbot helper to search courses in a more efficient and human way. Also created our own API to manage all courses and attach ratings and other data to them.
